# Introduction


Connected Objects are a powerful evolution of Network Objects.<br></br>
They comes with an enhanced and configurable RMI system.

See the <a href={pages.gnom.caches.connected_objects.getting_started}>next page</a> to know how to start with connected objects.<br></br>
Make sure you understood the <a href={pages.gnom.naming.index}>Network Objects concept</a> in order not to get lost while reading this part.

Some reminders:
- An Engine is a connection in a Linkit Network. It can either be the server or a client connection.
- The linkit's network operates in a <a href="https://learnlearn.uk/alevelcs/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2020/02/star-topology.png">star topology</a>.
In the diagrams below you'll see arrows directly pointing toward engines.
This is to simplify the diagrams as the topology is not important here.

## Summary

Roughly, Connected objects are Network Objects that gets handled by an <orange>RMI system</orange>.
This RMI system follows a <orange>contract</orange> that says what should happen when a connected object's method is invoked.
The <orange>contract</orange> is the <orange>most important</orange> part of the <orange>Connected Object System</orange>.
By configuring a contract, you specify how your connected objects will <orange>behave</orange> over the <orange>network</orange>.

The Features list below will introduce to things you can do with connected objects.<br></br>
Some features are not or not directly concerned by the contract.

# Features

### Invocation Flow Control (agreements)
When a method of a connected object gets called, the RMI system will follow it's bound <orange>agreement</orange>.
The agreement specify over which engines the method invocation must also be invoked,
and which engine is <orange>appointed</orange> to return the final result of the call.

#### Shared/Synchronized Objects

```scala
class MyWrapper[T](value: T = null) {
    def set(t: T): T = {
        val last = value
        value = t
        print(s"Changed value to '$value'")
        last
    }
    def get: T = value
}
```

In this example, we create a fully synchronized mutable object by specifying in our contract that when the `set(T): T` method
is invoked on an engine, the other engines that contains the same wrapper object also gets a call with the right parameters.

For our getter, we just handle it as a regular method, as we are sure that our local value is the same on other engines,
we don't want the invocation to get performed on our remote engines.


<Diagram light={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/Simple RMI.svg")}

         style={{width: "75%", height: "75%", display: "block", margin: "auto"}}/>
<br></br>

Therefore, we can simulate a "cloud", a "shared" object being accessed
from engines and which internal state is completely synchronized on each side.

#### Select specific engines and apply simple condition depending on the invocation context

You can define simple constraints on your agreements and then having different invocation flows depending on the initial method execution context:

In this example, we have different invocation flow depending on whether the object on which the method is initially called is the original object or not (in red on the diagram)<br></br>
```scala
class MyObject {
    /**
     * This method prints a param and return the current JVM version.
     * */
    def doSomething(param: String): String = {
        print(s"invocation called ! ($param)")
        System.getProperty("java.version")
    }
}
```

:::note
Connected Object owners are the engines that initially posted their objects over the network.

### Mirror Objects and Remote Implementation control {#mirroring}

This is actually one of the most powerful possibility when using Connected Objects.

A <orange>Mirror Object</orange> is a specific kind of connected object
where a <orange>Mirroring</orange> object is an "abstract object" in which all method invocations
are performed on a remote <orange>Mirrored</orange> object.<br></br>
This way, a Mirroring object can be a trait, interface or an abstract class and the Mirrored object is a remote implementation of the class.

Example :
We want to make an api to our server's database by defining a `DAO[T]` trait.<br></br>
The client only have the DAO trait on his side, and the server has the <orange>concrete class</orange> `PlayerDAO` that <orange>implements</orange> `DAO[Player]`

```scala title="DAO.scala"
trait DAO[A] {
    def get(id: Long): A
    def getAll: List[A]
    def save(a: A): Unit
    def update(a: A): Unit
    def delete(a: A): Unit
}
```

Now <orange>on the client side</orange>, when we retrieve our DAO object (see <a href="Getting Started">Getting Started page</a> to understand the first line)
we will be able to use a `DAO[Player]` (Mirroring) object where its implementation is on the server-side (Mirrored).

```scala showLineNumbers title="on client-side:"
val playerDAO: DAO[Player] = cache.findObject(0).get //this line retrieves the playerDAO object from server's cache
val player = Player(name="Rico", id=78)
playerDAO.save(player)
playerDAO.get(id=78) == player //true
```

Here's what happened over the network :

<details>
    <summary>How does it work ?</summary>
    <p>
        The Linkit Framework <orange>generates</orange> an implementation class for any <orange>Connected Object</orange>.<br></br>
        This allows the RMI System to handle the object's methods invocation by <orange>overriding</orange> all methods of the object's class.<br></br>
        When a method is <orange>invoked</orange> on a connected object, its generated implementation will follow the <orange>associated</orange> contract.<br></br>
    </p>
    <p>
        For <orange>Mirroring Objects</orange>, it's the same principle;<br></br>
        When the DAO object got retrieved at first line, the Linkit Framework followed the contract on server-side that said
        "Use stub class 'DAO[T]' when other engines access this object if it's a <orange>mirrored object</orange>" and so generated
        a concrete implementation for `DAO[T]` on client-side.
    </p>
</details>



### Know who is the invocation origin

Using the utility method `ExecutorEngine.currentEngine`, you can know who is the origin of the execution of a method.
This is actually very powerful combined with the possibility of making <orange>Mirrored Objects</orange> as
you can choose to perform different actions or checks depending on the engine that accesses a method.

```scala
class MyObject {
    /**
     * This method prints who originally invocated the method.
     * */
    def printInvoker(): Unit = {
        val origin = ExecutorEngine.currentEngine
        print(s"invocation called ! this RMI has been triggered from " + origin.identifier)
    }
}
```

<Diagram light={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/ExecutorEngine.svg")}
         dark={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/ExecutorEngine.svg")}
         style={{width: "75%", height: "75%", display: "block", margin: "auto"}}/>

### Static accesses (Work In Progress)

You can also access to statics of a class and thus define a contract for static methods.

You can open your own `StaticAccessor` and apply a custom contract for static methods,
or access to a specific engine's static accessor to call static methods on his side.

Example :<br></br>
- We want to know the time of the server we are connected on :

```scala
val serverDate = new Date(network.serverEngine.statics[System].currentTimeMillis())
```

To access a class (In this example, we access to the `System` class), the class must be allowed by the contract on remote-side.<br></br>
Some methods can be hided by the contract as well :

```scala
network.serverEngine.statics[System].exit(0) //throws HiddenMethodInvocationException.
```

### Apply contract on parameters and return values

#### Mirror / connect parameters and return values
It's possible to propagate object connection by specifying in a contract that parameter and / or return value of a method should be converted to
a connected object.

Example :<br></br>
We want to develop a game with players evolving on a map.

Here is our Player class :
```scala title="mygame.Player.scala - implementation on both side"
trait Player {
    val name: String
    def shoot(): Unit
    def hit(damage: Double): Unit
    def move(x: Int, y: Int): Unit
}
```
And our map trait :
```scala title="mygame.Map.scala - implementation on server-side"
trait Map {
    @throws[Exception]("if a client already created his player")
    def newPlayer(name: String): Player
    def getPlayer(name: String): Player //returns the same Player instance as returned by #newPlayer
}
```

Here is our contract (defined here using the bhv language)
```bhv title="game_network.bhv"
import mygame.Player
import mygame.Map
describe Player {
    foreach method enable following broadcast
}
describe Map {
    //connect keyword in front of a parameter or return type stipulates that the value must be connected.
    newPlayer(String): connect Player
}
```

On <orange>server-side</orange>, we initially create one <orange>mirrored</orange> object which is a `MapImpl` object.<br></br>
On <orange>client-side</orange>, we retrieve the map object, and we initialize our player using `Map#newPlayer`.<br></br>
By specifying in our contract that the return value of `Map#newPlayer` must be converted to a connected Player,
the client will retrieve a connected instance of `Player`.<br></br>
And as all method invocation of `Player` are to be broadcast, `Player` objects will be completely synchronized, and then for example,
when a client's player moves or shoots, all other clients, and the server, will be aware that the player changed.

#### Also Connect field values of connected objects
it's also possible to specify which field of a connected object we want to be connected as well:
```bhv title="example.bhv"
describe Example {
    connected field1
    mirror field2
}
```

#### Apply modifiers
