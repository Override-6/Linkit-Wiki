# Introduction


Connected Objects are a powerful evolution of Network Objects.<br></br>
They comes with an enhanced and configurable RMI system.

See the <a href={pages.gnom.caches.connected_objects.getting_started}>next page</a> to know how to start with connected objects.<br></br>
Make sure you understood the <a href={pages.gnom.naming.index}>Network Objects concept</a> in order not to get lost while reading this part.

Some reminders:
- An Engine is a connection in a Linkit Network. It can either be the server or a client connection.
- The linkit's network operates in a <a href="https://learnlearn.uk/alevelcs/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2020/02/star-topology.png">star topology</a>.
In the diagrams below you'll see arrows directly pointing toward engines.
This is to simplify the diagrams as the topology is not important here.

## Summary

Roughly, Connected objects are Network Objects that gets handled by an <orange>RMI system</orange>.
This RMI system follows a <orange>contract</orange> that says what should happen when a connected object's method get invoked.
The <orange>contract</orange> is the <orange>most important</orange> part of the <orange>Connected Object System</orange>.
By configuring a contract, you specify how your connected objects will <orange>behave</orange> over the <orange>network</orange>.

The Features list below will introduce to things you can do with connected objects.<br></br>
Some features are not or not directly concerned by the contract.

# Features

### Invocation Flow Control (agreements)
When a method of a connected object gets called, the RMI system will follow it's bound <orange>agreement</orange>.
The agreements specify which engines the invocation must spread onto,
and which engine is <orange>appointed</orange> to return the final result of the call.

#### Shared/Synchronized Objects

```scala
class MyWrapper[T](value: T = null) {
    def set(t: T): T = {
        val last = value
        value = t
        print(s"Changed value to '$value'")
        last
    }
    def get: T = value
}
```

In this example, we create a fully synchronized mutable object by specifying in our contract that when the `set(T): T` method
is invoked on an engine, the other engines that contains the same wrapper object also gets a call with the right parameters.

For our getter, we just handle it as a regular method, as we are sure that our local value is the same on other engines,
we don't want the invocation to get performed on our remote engines.

         style={{width: "75%", height: "75%", display: "block", margin: "auto"}}/>
<br></br>

Therefore, we can simulate a "cloud", a "shared" object being accessed
from engines and which internal state is completely synchronized on each side.

#### Select specific engines and apply simple condition depending on the invocation context

You can define some constraints on your agreements depending on the initial method execution context:

```scala
class MyObject {
    /**
     * This method prints a param and return the current JVM version.
     * */
    def doSomething(param: String): String = {
        print(s"invocation called ! ($param)")
        System.getProperty("java.version")
    }
}
```

         dark={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/RMI Agreements - Conditions.drawio.svg")}
         style={{width: "100%", height: "100%", display: "block", margin: "auto"}}/>

:::note
On the diagram, the object is red when it's on the engine that initially owns the object.<br></br>
Connected Object owners are the engines that initially posted their objects over the network.

### Mirroring Objects and Remote Implementation control

This is actually one of the most powerful possibility when using Connected Objects.

A Mirroring Object is an object where all method invocation are performed on a remote engine that hosts the actual implementation of the object.
Thus, Mirroring objects can either be a normal object, or an abstract object, such as interfaces, traits or abstract classes.

Example :
We can make an api to our server's database by defining a `DAO[T]` trait.
The client only have the DAO trait on his side, and the server has the concrete class `PlayerDAO` that implements `DAO[Player]`

```scala
trait DAO[A] {
    def get(id: long): A
    def getAll: List[A]
    def save(a: A): Unit
    def update(a: A): Unit
    def delete(a: A): Unit
}
```

Now <orange>on the client side</orange>, when we retrieve our DAO object (see <a href="Getting Started">Getting Started page</a> to understand the first line)
we will be able to use a `DAO[Player]` object where its implementation is on the server-side.

```scala showLineNumbers
val playerDAO: DAO[Player] = cache.findObject(0).get //this line retrieves the playerDAO object from server's cache
val player = Player(name="Rico", id=78)
playerDAO.save(player)
playerDA0.get(id=78) == player //true
```

Here's what happened over the network :

<details>
    <summary>How does it work ?</summary>
    <p>
        The Linkit Framework <orange>generates</orange> an implementation class for any <orange>Connected Object</orange>.<br></br>
        This allows the RMI System to handle the object's methods invocation by <orange>overriding</orange> all methods of the object's class.<br></br>
        When a method is <orange>invoked</orange> on a connected object, its generated implementation will follow the <orange>associated</orange> contract.<br></br>
    </p>
    <p>
        For <orange>Mirroring Objects</orange>, it's the same principle;<br></br>
        When the DAO object got retrieved at first line, the Linkit Framework followed the contract on server-side that said
        "Use stub class 'DAO[T]' when other engines access this object when it's a <orange>mirrored object</orange>" and so generated
        a concrete implementation for `DAO[T]` on client-side.
    </p>
</details>



### Know who is the invocation origin

Using the utility method `ExecutorEngine.currentEngine`, you can know who is the origin of the execution of a method.
This is actually very powerful combined with the possibility of making <orange>Mirrored Objects</orange> as
you can choose to perform different actions or checks depending on the client who accesses a method.

```scala
class MyObject {
    /**
     * This method prints who originally invocated the method.
     * */
    def printInvoker(): Unit = {
        val trigerrer = ExecutorEngine.currentEngine
        print(s"invocation called ! this RMI has been triggered from " + trigerrer.identifier)
    }
}
```

         dark={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/ExecutorEngine.svg")}
         style={{width: "75%", height: "75%", display: "block", margin: "auto"}}/>

### Static accesses (Work In Progress)

You can also access to statics of a class and thus define a contract for static methods.

You can open your own `StaticAccessor` and apply a custom contract for static methods,
or access to a specific engine's static accessor to call static methods on his side.

Example :<br></br>
- We want to know the time of the server we are connected on :

```scala
val serverDate = new Date(network.serverEngine.statics[System].currentTimeMillis())
```

To access a class (In this example, we access to the `System` class), the class must be allowed by the contract on remote-side.<br></br>
Some methods can be hided by the contract as well :

```scala
network.serverEngine.statics[System].exit(0) //throws HiddenMethodInvocationException.
```

### Apply modifiers on parameters and return values

### Inner object connection

#### Also Connect field values of connected objects

#### Also Connect param and return values on method invocations
